# Skip Google Redirect

This is a simple Firefox extension that triggers when you open the "www.google.com/url" page, which is a redirect page with the sole purpose of tracking your movements. The extension then reads the target address from the url and redirects you locally to your target page without ever notifying Google about it.

## Why?
The gmail app keeps placing every single url in every email behind one of these redirects. I got annoyed but couldn't find a mobile extension that prevents this. So here we are.

You might also get a slightly faster page load speed if you have a slow internet connection.
